---

## Verification Commands

### Check Root Directory:
```bash
ls -la *.md
```

**Expected:** Only CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, README.md

### Check Documentation Folders:
```bash
ls -la docs/setup/
ls -la docs/developer/ | grep TECHNICAL
ls -la docs/cleanup/
ls -la docs/verification/
```

**Expected:** All moved files in their new locations

### Search for Broken Links:
```bash
grep -r "API-SETUP-QUICKSTART.md" docs/ | grep -v "docs/setup"
grep -r "TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md" docs/ | grep -v "docs/developer"
```

**Expected:** No results (all links updated)

## Benefits of This Organization

### 1. **Cleaner Root Directory**
- Only essential files remain in root
- Easier to navigate project structure
- Follows standard conventions (README.md, CLAUDE.md)

### 2. **Logical Grouping**
- Setup guides together in `/docs/setup/`
- Developer docs together in `/docs/developer/`
- Cleanup reports together in `/docs/cleanup/`
- Verification docs together in `/docs/verification/`

### 3. **Easier Discovery**
- New developers know where to find docs
- Clear separation by purpose
- Consistent naming conventions

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Easier to update related docs together
- Clear ownership by category
- Reduced clutter

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Consider Moving to Archive:
If not actively used, these files could move to `/docs/archive/`:
- Any outdated status reports
- Superseded documentation

### Consider Creating:
- `/docs/deployment/` - Deployment guides and configs
  - Could move `/k8s/` here as `/docs/deployment/kubernetes/`
- `/docs/api/` - API-specific documentation
  - Could move API guides here
