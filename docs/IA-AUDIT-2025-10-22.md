# Information Architecture Audit - Jengu Pricing Intelligence Platform

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Auditor**: Senior Product/UX Architect & Staff Engineer
**Status**: Complete Audit + Proposed Reorganization

## Executive Summary

The current IA has **8 main pages** with a workflow-oriented navigation (numbered 1-5). While the intent is good, the structure has significant UX problems:

### Critical Issues Found:

1. **Mixed Mental Models**: Workflow steps (1-5) mixed with utility pages (Dashboard, Director, Assistant)
2. **Unclear Entry Point**: Dashboard should be the hub but is buried mid-list
3. **Duplicate Concepts**: "Insights" (analytics) vs "Director View" (executive analytics) vs "Dashboard" (overview)
4. **Cognitive Overload**: 8 pages with unclear relationships
5. **Inconsistent Naming**: "Pricing Engine" vs "Optimize Prices" label mismatch
6. **Hidden Features**: Critical features (Director Dashboard with V2 charts) not prominent

## Current Structure Analysis

### Current Navigation (Sidebar)

```
📋 Workflow (Forced Sequential):
├── 1. Settings (Setup your business)
├── 2. Upload Data (Import pricing data)
├── 3. Market Data (Collect competitor prices)
├── 4. Insights (Analyze trends)
└── 5. Optimize Prices (AI recommendations) ⭐

📊 Utility Pages:
├── Dashboard (Overview & metrics)
├── Director View (Executive analytics) 👑
└── AI Assistant (Ask questions)
```

### Current Routes

```typescript
/dashboard           // Overview with KPIs
/data                // CSV upload & file management
/competitor-monitor  // Competitor scraping
/insights            // Analytics charts (old)
/pricing-engine      // Price optimization
/director            // Executive dashboard (new V2 charts)
/assistant           // Claude-powered Q&A
/settings            // Business profile setup
```

### Page Purposes & Content

| Page                   | Purpose                  | Key Features                            | Complexity | Issues                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Dashboard**          | Overview metrics         | KPIs, quick stats, chart previews       | Medium     | Not prominent, unclear value vs Insights |
| **Data**               | File management          | CSV upload, enrichment, preview         | High       | Core feature, good placement             |
| **Competitor Monitor** | Market data              | Scraping, comparison                    | Medium     | Rarely used workflow step                |
| **Insights**           | Analytics (V1)           | Weather impact, correlations, forecasts | High       | Outdated, overlaps with Director         |
| **Pricing Engine**     | Optimization             | Price quotes, ML predictions            | Very High  | Core feature, confusing label            |
| **Director Dashboard** | Executive analytics (V2) | 7 ECharts visualizations, KPIs          | Very High  | New, hidden, best analytics              |
| **Assistant**          | AI Q&A                   | Claude chat, suggestions                | Medium     | Useful but not core workflow             |
| **Settings**           | Configuration            | Business profile, API keys              | Low        | Positioned as step 1, rarely revisited   |

## User Flow Analysis

### Intended Workflow (Current)

```
Settings → Upload Data → Get Market Data → View Insights → Optimize Prices
   1️⃣          2️⃣              3️⃣              4️⃣              5️⃣
```

**Problems**:

- ❌ Rigid sequence doesn't match real behavior
- ❌ Settings rarely need updating after initial setup
- ❌ Competitor data is optional, not critical path
- ❌ Insights step is vague (which insights? old or new?)
- ❌ Dashboard/Director/Assistant are "homeless" in the workflow

### Actual User Needs (Observed)

1. **First-time users**: Need onboarding → Data → Quick Win (price quote)
2. **Daily users**: Check dashboard → Upload new data → Get price recommendations
3. **Analysts**: Deep dive into analytics (Director Dashboard)
4. **Executives**: Review performance (Director Dashboard KPIs)
5. **Power users**: Experiment with Assistant, explore Competitor Monitor

## Pain Points & Problems

### 1. Navigation Confusion

- **Issue**: Users don't know where to start
- **Evidence**: Dashboard buried at #6, Settings forced at #1
- **Impact**: High bounce rate, onboarding friction

### 2. Feature Discoverability

- **Issue**: Best features hidden (Director Dashboard, V2 charts)
- **Evidence**: Director View labeled as advanced, no clear upgrade path
- **Impact**: Users miss value, low feature adoption

### 3. Naming Inconsistency

- **Pricing Engine** (route) vs **Optimize Prices** (label)
- **Insights** (old charts) vs **Director View** (new charts)
- **Impact**: Mental model mismatch, confusion

### 4. Information Hierarchy

- **Issue**: Flat structure, no grouping
- **Evidence**: All pages at same level, no parent/child relationships
- **Impact**: Hard to find related features

### 5. Workflow Rigidity

- **Issue**: Numbered steps imply sequence, but users need flexibility
- **Evidence**: Users want to check Dashboard before uploading data
- **Impact**: Frustration with forced path

### Route Changes

| Old Route             | New Route                  | Change Reason                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `/dashboard`          | `/` or `/home`             | Make it the root               |
| `/insights`           | `/analytics`               | Clearer name, unified view     |
| `/director`           | `/analytics?view=advanced` | Integrate with Analytics       |
| `/pricing-engine`     | `/pricing/optimizer`       | Better mental model            |
| `/competitor-monitor` | `/pricing/competitors`     | Group related features         |
| `/data`               | `/data-sources`            | More descriptive               |
| `/assistant`          | `/tools/assistant`         | Group utility tools            |
| `/settings`           | `/tools/settings`          | De-emphasize, still accessible |

### Feature Flag Strategy

**Flags to Implement**:

```typescript
interface NavigationFlags {
  // Core
  useNewNavigation: boolean // Enable new IA
  useGroupedSidebar: boolean // Collapsible sections

  // Analytics
  unifyAnalyticsPages: boolean // Merge Insights + Director
  defaultToAdvancedAnalytics: boolean // Show V2 charts by default

  // Pricing
  usePricingSectionGroup: boolean // Group Optimizer + Competitors

  // Onboarding
  showQuickStartWizard: boolean // First-time user guide
  highlightCoreActions: boolean // Spotlight on Dashboard
}
```

**Rollout Plan**:

1. **Phase 1**: Implement new navigation behind flag (both UIs coexist)
2. **Phase 2**: Merge Analytics pages with view toggle
3. **Phase 3**: Update routes with 301 redirects
4. **Phase 4**: Enable for 10% users, monitor metrics
5. **Phase 5**: Full rollout, remove old code

## Usability Improvements

### 1. Dashboard as Hub

**Current**: Buried in middle of navigation
**New**: First page, with quick actions to all core features

**Dashboard Cards** (Proposed):

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ 💰 Get Price    │ 📤 Upload Data  │
│ Quote Now       │ Add CSV         │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ 📊 View         │ 🤖 Ask AI       │
│ Analytics       │ Assistant       │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### 2. Analytics Unification

**Current**: 2 separate pages (Insights, Director)
**New**: Single page with view toggle

**Benefits**:

- Reduce confusion about which analytics to use
- Progressive disclosure (Basic → Advanced)
- Seamless upgrade path with feature flag

### 3. Clearer Labels

| Old                  | New                  | Reason                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| "Pricing Engine"     | "Price Optimizer"    | Less technical, clearer value |
| "Competitor Monitor" | "Competitor Intel"   | Snappier, implies insights    |
| "Data"               | "Data Sources"       | More specific                 |
| "Director View"      | "Advanced Analytics" | Not role-specific             |

### 4. Reduce Cognitive Load

**Current**: 8 flat pages
**New**: 4 top-level + 3 grouped sections = 7 total, better organized

**Measurement**: Time to find feature, clicks to complete task

## Technical Implementation Plan

- [ ] Create `useNavigationFlags()` hook with Zustand
- [ ] Build new `CollapsibleSidebar` component
- [ ] Implement route alias system (old → new)
- [ ] Add navigation toggle UI (dev tools)

### Phase 2: Page Reorganization (Week 2)

- [ ] Rename routes (keep old routes with redirects)
- [ ] Create unified Analytics page with tabs
- [ ] Move Pricing Engine → `/pricing/optimizer`
- [ ] Move Competitor Monitor → `/pricing/competitors`
- [ ] Update all internal links

### Phase 3: Dashboard Redesign (Week 3)

- [ ] Make Dashboard the root route (`/`)
- [ ] Add quick action cards
- [ ] Add KPI summary from all pages
- [ ] Add "What's New" section for features

### Phase 4: Feature Flag Testing (Week 4)

- [ ] Enable for dev team
- [ ] A/B test metrics (time on task, feature discovery)
- [ ] Gather feedback
- [ ] Iterate based on data

### Phase 5: Rollout (Week 5)

- [ ] Enable for 10% users
- [ ] Monitor analytics (bounce rate, navigation paths)
- [ ] Enable for 50% users
- [ ] Full rollout
- [ ] Remove old navigation code

## Success Metrics

**Before** (Baseline to Measure):

- Time to complete first price quote: ~X minutes
- Feature discovery rate (Director Dashboard): ~Y%
- User satisfaction (NPS): Z

**After** (Target):

- ⬇️ 30% reduction in time to first quote
- ⬆️ 50% increase in Director Dashboard discovery
- ⬆️ 15 point NPS improvement
- ⬇️ 40% reduction in support tickets about navigation

**Tracking**:

- Google Analytics events for navigation
- Hotjar heatmaps for sidebar usage
- PostHog feature flags + metrics
- User interviews (n=10)

## Accessibility Considerations

- ✅ Keyboard navigation for collapsible sections (Enter/Space to toggle)
- ✅ ARIA labels for grouped navigation
- ✅ Focus management when switching views
- ✅ Screen reader announcements for active section
- ✅ High contrast mode support
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile sidebar collapse)

## Migration Path for Existing Users

### For Bookmarks:

- All old routes redirect with 301
- Toast notification: "We've reorganized! You're now at [New Location]"

### For Onboarding:

- Show "What's New" modal on first login after migration
- Highlight key changes (Dashboard first, Analytics unified)
- Optional guided tour (skip-able)

### For Documentation:

- Update all screenshots
- Update help articles
- Add migration guide
- Video walkthrough

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                          | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Users confused by change      | High   | Medium     | Feature flag rollout, onboarding modal, clear messaging |
| Broken links in external docs | Medium | High       | 301 redirects, update docs pre-launch                   |
| Performance regression        | Low    | Low        | Lazy load sections, measure bundle size                 |
| Feature adoption drops        | High   | Low        | Highlight new features, A/B test, rollback flag         |
| Accessibility issues          | Medium | Medium     | Audit with axe, manual testing, screen reader testing   |

## Next Steps (Immediate Actions)

1. **Get Stakeholder Buy-In**: Present this audit + proposal
2. **User Testing**: Test new IA with 5 users (card sorting, tree testing)
3. **Technical Spike**: Estimate effort for each phase (1-2 days)
4. **Create Designs**: High-fidelity mockups for new navigation (Figma)
5. **Implement Phase 1**: Feature flags + infrastructure (1 week)

## Appendix: Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option A: Keep Current Structure, Minor Tweaks

- ❌ Doesn't solve fundamental problems
- ❌ Incremental improvement only
- ✅ Low risk, minimal effort

### Option B: Radical Redesign (Single-Page Dashboard)

- ✅ Modern, all-in-one view
- ❌ High complexity, long implementation
- ❌ Doesn't fit all user types (analysts need depth)

### Option C: Proposed Approach (Grouped Navigation)

- ✅ Balances simplicity and depth
- ✅ Incremental rollout with feature flags
- ✅ Proven pattern in similar SaaS apps
- ✅ **Recommended**

---

**Recommendation**: Proceed with **Option C** (Proposed Reorganization) using phased rollout with feature flags. Estimated effort: 4-5 weeks for full implementation, but can ship Phase 1 in 1 week.
