# Task Management

- Completed tasks are in `tasks-done/`
- Uncompleted tasks are in `tasks-todo/`
  - Tasks are named `task-[number]-[name].md` where number is the order in which tasks should be completed. The lowest number is the current task.
  - If [number] is an `x` it has not been prioritised yet and should not be worked on.
