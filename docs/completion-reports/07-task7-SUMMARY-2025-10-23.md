## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Database Schema

**File**: `backend/prisma/competitor-daily-schema.sql`

Three tables created:

- **competitor_daily**: Stores daily price bands (P10, P50, P90)
  - Unique constraint on (property_id, date)
  - Check constraints ensure P10 ≤ P50 ≤ P90
  - RLS policies for user isolation

- **competitor_targets**: Scraping configuration per property
  - Location, room type, search radius
  - Scraping frequency and priority
  - Last/next scrape timestamps

- **competitor_scrape_log**: Scraping history and errors
  - Status tracking (success, partial, failed)
  - Performance metrics (duration, competitors found)
  - Proxy and user-agent used

### 2. Playwright Scraper

**File**: `backend/services/competitorScraper.ts`

Features:

- ✅ Booking.com scraping (working)
- ✅ robots.txt compliance (respects disallow rules)
- ✅ Proxy rotation via ProxyPool class
- ✅ Percentile calculation (P10, P50, P90)
- ✅ Graceful error handling and browser cleanup
- 🔄 Hotels.com scraper (placeholder)
- 🔄 Expedia scraper (placeholder)

Key methods:

```typescript
async scrapeBookingCom(params: SearchParams): Promise<ScrapeResult>
calculatePricePercentiles(competitors: CompetitorResult[]): Percentiles
```

### 3. Competitor Data Service

**File**: `backend/services/competitorDataService.ts`

CRUD operations for competitor data:

```typescript
storeCompetitorData() // Upsert daily price bands
getCompetitorData() // Get single date data
getCompetitorDataRange() // Get date range
upsertCompetitorTarget() // Create/update scraping target
getNextScrapingTargets() // Get targets due for scraping
logScrapeResult() // Record scraping attempt
```

### 4. Background Worker

**File**: `backend/workers/competitorWorker.ts`

BullMQ worker with:

- Playwright browser initialization per job
- Property ownership verification
- Automatic percentile calculation
- Data upsert with conflict resolution
- Progress tracking (10%, 20%, 30%, 70%, 80%, 100%)
- Graceful browser cleanup in `finally` block

### 5. Cron Scheduler

**File**: `backend/workers/competitorCronWorker.ts`

Automated daily scraping:

- Schedule: 2 AM daily (configurable via env var)
- Fetches all enabled targets
- Enqueues jobs for 7 days ahead
- Updates next scrape time
- Priority-based queueing

Start scheduler:

```bash
cd backend
npx tsx workers/competitorCronWorker.ts
```

### 6. API Endpoints

**File**: `backend/routes/competitorData.ts`

6 REST endpoints:

```
GET    /api/competitor-data/:propertyId/:date
GET    /api/competitor-data/:propertyId/range?startDate=X&endDate=Y
POST   /api/competitor-data/:propertyId/scrape
POST   /api/competitor-data/targets
GET    /api/competitor-data/targets
GET    /api/competitor-data/:propertyId/history
```

All endpoints:

- Require authentication (JWT)
- Filter by userId (RLS)
- Return structured JSON responses

### 7. Pricing Engine Integration ✨ NEW

**Files**:

- `pricing-service/competitor_data_client.py`
- `pricing-service/pricing_engine.py` (updated)

Features:

- Auto-fetches competitor data if not provided in request
- Uses P50 (median) as baseline price
- Calculates positioning (budget/market/premium)
- Generates detailed reasoning:
  - "Premium positioning: €195.50 vs market median €180.00 (+9%)"
  - "Market range: €120.00 (low) to €250.00 (high)"
  - "Based on 15 competitor properties (booking.com)"
- Returns competitor metadata in `safety` field
- 5-second timeout with graceful fallback

Example response:

```json
{
  "price": 195.5,
  "reasons": [
    "Market-aligned: €195.50 vs market median €180.00 (+9%)",
    "Market range: €120.00 (low) to €250.00 (high)",
    "Based on 15 competitor properties (booking.com)"
  ],
  "safety": {
    "competitor_data": {
      "p10": 120.0,
      "p50": 180.0,
      "p90": 250.0,
      "count": 15,
      "source": "booking.com"
    }
  }
}
```

### 8. Integration Tests ✨ NEW

**File**: `backend/test/competitorScraper.test.ts`

Comprehensive test suite:

- ✅ robots.txt compliance tests (4 scenarios)
- ✅ Percentile calculation tests (5 scenarios)
- ✅ URL building tests (2 scenarios)
- ✅ Error handling tests (timeout, cleanup)
- ✅ ProxyPool tests (rotation, auth, empty list)
- ✅ Integration tests (full workflow)

Total: 15+ test cases

Run tests:

```bash
cd backend
pnpm test competitorScraper.test.ts
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Technical Decisions

1. **Why Playwright over Puppeteer**: Better TypeScript support, multi-browser, active development
2. **Why percentiles over raw prices**: Resistant to outliers, statistical robustness
3. **Why upsert on (property_id, date)**: Idempotency for daily refresh jobs
4. **Why separate competitor worker**: Scraping takes 20+ seconds, needs separate queue
5. **Why 5-second timeout for pricing fetch**: Keep pricing response fast, fallback to internal model

### Best Practices Applied

- ✅ robots.txt compliance (ethical scraping)
- ✅ Proxy rotation (avoid IP bans)
- ✅ Rate limiting (5 req/min per worker)
- ✅ Graceful error handling (fallback to internal pricing)
- ✅ Progress tracking (WebSocket real-time updates)
- ✅ Idempotent operations (upsert with unique constraints)
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (unit + integration)
- ✅ Security (RLS, JWT auth, no PII scraped)
