# ðŸ”§ Fix Login Issue - Disable Email Confirmation

## Problem

You can't log in with existing credentials and always have to sign up again.

## Root Cause

Supabase has **email confirmation** enabled by default. Users must confirm their email before they can log in.

## Solution: Disable Email Confirmation

Follow these steps to disable email confirmation in your Supabase dashboard:

### 2. Navigate to Authentication Settings

1. In the left sidebar, click **"Authentication"**

## Alternative Solution (If You Want Email Confirmation)

If you prefer to keep email confirmation enabled for security:

2. Look for an email from **Supabase** with subject "Confirm Your Email"
3. Click the **confirmation link** in the email
4. Then try logging in again

## Enhanced Error Messages

I've already updated the Auth.tsx component to provide clearer error messages:

- **"Invalid email or password"** - Check your credentials or sign up
- **"Please check your email to confirm"** - Email confirmation required
- **"Please check your email and click the confirmation link"** - After signup

After disabling email confirmation, test the complete flow:

1. âœ… **Sign up** a new test account
2. âœ… **Log in immediately** (no email confirmation needed)

4. âœ… **Log out** (click logout button in sidebar)
