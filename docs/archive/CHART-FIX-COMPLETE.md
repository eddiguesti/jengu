# Chart Loading Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problem Solved
You reported: **"some charts arewnt loading"**

## Root Cause
The Dashboard was trying to load data from the **first file** in your uploaded files list. That file was deleted (showing 404 errors in console), so the charts had no data to display.

## Solution Applied

### Changed File: [frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx](frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx#L42-L46)

**Before:**
```typescript
const { data: uploadedFiles = [] } = useUploadedFiles()
const firstFileId = uploadedFiles[0]?.id || ''  // ‚ùå Blindly uses first file
const { data: fileData = [] } = useFileData(firstFileId, 10000)
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { data: uploadedFiles = [] } = useUploadedFiles()

// ‚úÖ Filter out deleted/empty files
const validFiles = uploadedFiles.filter(
  (f) => f.status !== 'deleted' && (f.actualRows || f.rows || 0) > 0
)

const firstFileId = validFiles[0]?.id || ''  // ‚úÖ Uses first VALID file
const { data: fileData = [], isLoading, error } = useFileData(firstFileId, 10000)

// ‚úÖ Log errors for debugging
if (error) {
  console.warn('Failed to load file data:', error)
}
```

## What This Fix Does

1. **Filters out deleted files** - Skips files with `status: 'deleted'`
2. **Filters out empty files** - Skips files with 0 rows
3. **Uses first valid file** - Dashboard now loads from the first file that has actual data
4. **Logs errors** - If data fetch fails, you'll see a warning in console (not a breaking error)

## Result

‚úÖ **Charts now load automatically** from the first valid file in your uploads
‚úÖ **No more 404 errors** breaking the dashboard
‚úÖ **Resilient to deleted files** - automatically skips them

## Test It Now

### Option 1: If You Already Have Valid Data
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/
2. Dashboard should now show charts automatically
3. If you see charts ‚Üí **FIXED!** ‚úÖ

### Option 2: Upload Fresh Data
If you still don't see charts (maybe all files were deleted):

1. Go to http://localhost:5173/tools/data
2. Upload a CSV file with pricing data (drag & drop)
3. Map columns if prompted
4. Click "Start Enrichment"
5. Wait for green "Enriched" badge
6. Go back to Dashboard ‚Üí Charts should appear

## What Charts Should You See?

When working correctly, the Dashboard shows:

### 1. Price & Demand Calendar
- Interactive heatmap showing pricing patterns
- Click dates to see details

### 2. KPI Cards (Top Row)
- Total Records count
- Average Price (‚Ç¨)
- Occupancy Rate (%)
- ML Predictions status

### 3. Revenue Performance Chart
- Monthly revenue (last 6 months)
- Area chart with yellow gradient

### 4. Weekly Occupancy Chart
- Average occupancy by day of week
- Bar chart (Mon-Sun)

### 5. Price Trend Chart
- Daily price changes (last 30 days)
- Line chart in green

## Bonus Fixes

Also fixed while investigating:

1. **Removed unused `selectedDate` state** - cleaned up TypeScript warning
2. **Removed unused `useState` import** - cleaner code
3. **Created detailed analysis** - see [CHART-LOADING-ANALYSIS.md](CHART-LOADING-ANALYSIS.md)

## Verification

Check that all these work:

```bash
# From project root
pnpm run type-check  # Should pass (Dashboard.tsx has no errors now)
```

### Browser Console
- ‚ùå Before: `404 /api/files/d17533b0-2c66-46ec-bc71-77fcb8c83eb7`
- ‚úÖ After: No 404 errors (or ignored if file is actually deleted)

### Dashboard UI
- ‚ùå Before: Empty state or "Add Data to See Your Complete Dashboard"
- ‚úÖ After: Charts, KPIs, and calendar all showing with real data

## Files Changed

1. [frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx](frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx)
   - Lines 1: Removed `useState` import
   - Lines 42-52: Added file filtering and error handling
   - Line 226: Removed unused `selectedDate` state
   - Line 293: Removed `setSelectedDate` usage

## Summary

**The charts were failing because Dashboard tried to load from a deleted file.**

**Now fixed:** Dashboard automatically finds and uses the first valid file with data.

**Your charts should work now!** üéâ

If you still have issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you have uploaded data with rows
3. Check that enrichment completed successfully (green badge)
4. See [CHART-LOADING-ANALYSIS.md](CHART-LOADING-ANALYSIS.md) for detailed troubleshooting

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the Dashboard - charts should appear now
2. If still broken, check console and share error messages
3. If working, test other pages (Pricing Engine, Assistant)
