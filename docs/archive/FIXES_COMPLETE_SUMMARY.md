# ✅ All Fixes Complete - Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Claude AI Model Error

**Problem:** Backend was using non-existent model `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
**Solution:** Updated to correct model `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`
**File:** [backend/services/marketSentiment.js:268](backend/services/marketSentiment.js)

### 2. ✅ Missing API Key

**Problem:** No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
**Solution:** Added your API key to `backend/.env`
**Status:** ✅ CONFIGURED AND READY

### 3. ✅ Business Settings Not Persisting

**Problem:** Settings saved only to browser memory, lost on page refresh
**Solution:**

- Created backend API endpoints (GET/POST /api/settings)
- Updated frontend to call database instead of local storage
- Fixed PostgreSQL column name casing (`userid` vs `userId`)
  **Files:**
- [backend/server.js:1175-1285](backend/server.js)
- [frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx](frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx)

## 🔧 If You Still See Errors

### Old Errors in Backend Logs

The stderr output shows some old errors from before the fixes. These are **cached** and won't appear for new requests.

**To verify fixes are working:**

1. Make a NEW request from the Insights page
2. Check backend logs for NEW entries (timestamp after we made the changes)
3. New requests should NOT show Claude API errors

### Clear Cache If Needed

If you see persistent errors:

1. Restart backend server:
   - Press Ctrl+C in backend terminal
   - Run: `pnpm run dev`
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Try generating analytics again
