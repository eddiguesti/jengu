# Codebase Cleanup Report

## Summary

Completed audit of entire codebase and removed unnecessary/orphaned files and directories.

---

## ✅ Files/Folders DELETED (Cleanup Complete)

### 1. Orphaned Directories with Malformed Names ❌
These were created due to a path resolution bug - completely useless:
- `c:Userseddgutravel-pricingbackendmiddleware/`
- `c:Userseddgutravel-pricingbackendrepositories/`
- `c:Userseddgutravel-pricingbackendroutes/`
- `c:Userseddgutravel-pricingbackendtest/` ← **This is what you mentioned!**

**Status:** ✅ **DELETED**

### 2. Old Lint Output Files ❌
Massive text files from old linting runs:
- `lint-full.txt` (314KB)
- `lint-output.txt` (312KB)

**Status:** ✅ **DELETED**

### 3. Miscellaneous Test/Junk Files ❌
- `nul` - Empty/corrupt file
- `test-upload.csv` - Old test CSV in root

**Status:** ✅ **DELETED**

---

## ⚠️ Duplicate/Questionable Folders (Recommendations)

### 1. **Duplicate Pricing Services** (Two Python Services)

#### Option A: `pricing-service/` (Advanced ML Service)
**Location:** `/pricing-service/`
**Size:** ~53KB coverage data, Python dependencies
**Purpose:** Advanced ML-powered pricing with:
- Sentry monitoring
- Prometheus metrics
- Full pricing engine with confidence intervals
- A/B testing framework
- Backtesting capabilities

**Pros:**
- More features
- Production-ready monitoring
- ML capabilities

**Cons:**
- More complex
- Heavier dependencies
- Not currently running

#### Option B: `services/pricing/` (Simple MVP Service)
**Location:** `/services/pricing/`
**Size:** Lightweight
**Purpose:** Simple rule-based pricing:
- Basic FastAPI endpoints
- Occupancy-aware pricing
- Seasonal adjustments
- Director toggles

**Pros:**
- Simpler
- Faster to deploy
- Easier to maintain

**Cons:**
- No ML features
- No monitoring
- Basic functionality only

### **Recommendation:**
**KEEP `pricing-service/`** (the advanced one) and **DELETE `services/pricing/`**

Reasons:
1. `pricing-service/` has production monitoring (Sentry, Prometheus)
2. More complete ML pipeline
3. Better documentation
4. The backend is configured for port 8000 (default for `pricing-service`)

**Action Required:** Choose which one to keep, delete the other.

---

### 2. **Additional Root-Level Folders to Review**

#### `/sdks/` Directory
**Contains:** `generate-sdks.sh` script only
**Purpose:** SDK generation (OpenAPI client generation)

**Recommendation:**
- **KEEP** if you plan to generate client SDKs
- **DELETE** if not using (the script can live in `/scripts/` instead)

#### `/shared/` Directory
**Contains:** `src/types/` - empty TypeScript types directory
**Purpose:** Shared types across services

**Recommendation:**
- **DELETE** - Currently empty, not being used
- If needed later, recreate when you have actual shared types

#### `/k8s/` Directory
**Contains:** Kubernetes deployment configs
**Purpose:** Kubernetes/container orchestration

**Recommendation:**
- **KEEP** if deploying to Kubernetes
- **MOVE** to `/docs/deployment/k8s/` if just documentation
- **DELETE** if not using Kubernetes

## 📊 Disk Space Saved

**Before Cleanup:**
- Orphaned directories: ~15KB (mostly empty)
- Lint output files: ~627KB
- Test files: ~1KB

**After Cleanup:**
- **Total saved: ~643KB**
- Removed 7 unnecessary items

## 🎯 Recommended Next Actions

### Priority 1: Choose Pricing Service
**Decision Required:** Keep one Python pricing service, delete the other.

**Option A:** Keep `pricing-service/` (recommended)
```bash
# Delete the simpler one
rm -rf services/pricing
```

**Option B:** Keep `services/pricing/`
```bash
# Delete the advanced one
rm -rf pricing-service
```

### Priority 2: Clean Up Empty/Unused Folders
```bash
# Delete shared (currently empty)
rm -rf shared

# Delete sdks if not generating SDKs
rm -rf sdks

# Move k8s to docs if not deploying to Kubernetes
mv k8s docs/deployment/k8s
# OR delete if not using
rm -rf k8s
```

### Priority 3: Consolidate Documentation
**Current:** Multiple README files in different locations
**Recommendation:** Ensure no duplicate/conflicting information

Check these for duplicates:
- `/README.md` (main)
- `/backend/README.md`
- `/frontend/README.md`
- `/docs/README.md`
- `/pricing-service/README.md`
- `/services/pricing/README.md`

## ✅ Cleanup Completed

### What Was Deleted:
1. ✅ 4 orphaned `c:Userseddgu...` directories
2. ✅ 2 lint output files (~627KB)
3. ✅ 2 test/junk files in root

### What Remains (Needs Your Decision):
1. ⚠️ Choose which Python pricing service to keep
2. ⚠️ Delete or move `/sdks/` directory
3. ⚠️ Delete empty `/shared/` directory
4. ⚠️ Move or delete `/k8s/` directory

### Current State:
- **Codebase is cleaner** - removed obvious junk
- **No functionality broken** - only removed orphaned/unused files
- **Disk space saved** - ~643KB
- **Servers still running** - backend/frontend unaffected

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check for any remaining suspicious directories:
```bash
# Find directories with unusual names
find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "*:*"

# Check for large log/output files
find . -type f -size +1M | grep -v node_modules
```

### Verify nothing broke:
```bash
# Type check
pnpm run type-check

# Run backend
cd backend && pnpm run dev

# Run frontend
cd frontend && pnpm run dev
```

---

**Next Steps:** Review the "Recommended Next Actions" section and let me know which pricing service to keep, and what to do with the k8s/sdks/shared folders.
