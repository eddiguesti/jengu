---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run Setup Wizard

```bash
.venv\Scripts\streamlit run apps\ui\pages\01_Setup.py
```

The wizard will ask for:
- Business name (e.g., "Riviera Campasun")
- Business type (Hotel, Campsite, Resort, etc.)
- Country & City

**It will automatically**:
- Geocode your location (lat/lon)
- Detect timezone
- Save to `data/config/business_profile.json`

### Step 2: Upload & Enrich Data

Navigate to **Data Enrichment** page:

1. Upload CSV/Excel with historical bookings
2. Map columns (date, price, bookings)
3. Click **Start Enrichment**

**The system will**:
- Fetch weather data for your location and date range
- Fetch holidays for your country
- Add 20+ temporal features
- Save to `data/enriched/bookings_enriched.parquet`

### Step 3: Analyze Correlations

Navigate to **Correlation Insights** page:

1. Select target variable (bookings, revenue, etc.)
2. Click **Analyze Correlations**
3. View:
   - Top 10 demand drivers (bar chart)
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Lag analysis (temporal relationships)
   - Auto-generated pricing weights

## 🔬 Correlation Methods Explained

The system uses **5 correlation methods** to discover relationships:

### 1. **Pearson Correlation** (Linear)
- Measures linear relationships
- Range: -1 to +1
- Example: "Temperature increases → Bookings increase"

### 2. **Spearman Correlation** (Monotonic)
- Measures rank-based relationships
- Better for non-linear but monotonic patterns
- Example: "Higher prices → Fewer bookings" (not necessarily linear)

### 3. **Mutual Information** (Nonlinear)
- Captures any dependency (linear or nonlinear)
- Powered by scikit-learn
- Example: "Weather quality (composite score) → Bookings"

### 4. **Lag Correlation** (Temporal)
- Discovers time-shifted relationships
- Tests lags from -7 to +7 days
- Example: "Weather 3 days ago → Today's bookings"

### 5. **ANOVA F-test** (Categorical)
- Tests categorical variables (holidays, seasons, day of week)
- Returns eta-squared (effect size)
- Example: "Bookings differ significantly between weekdays and weekends"

## 📊 What Gets Enriched

When you upload booking data, the system adds:

### Weather Features (from Open-Meteo)
- `temp_max`, `temp_min`, `temp_mean` - Temperature (°C)
- `precipitation`, `rain`, `snow` - Precipitation (mm)
- `windspeed_max` - Wind speed (km/h)
- `sunshine_hours` - Sunshine duration (seconds)
- `weather_quality` - Composite score (0-100)
- `is_rainy`, `is_snowy` - Boolean flags
- `temp_range` - Daily temperature range

### Holiday Features (from python-holidays)
- `is_holiday` - 1 if holiday, 0 otherwise
- `holiday_name` - Name of holiday (e.g., "Christmas")

### Temporal Features (engineered)
- `year`, `month`, `quarter` - Date components
- `day_of_week` (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)
- `week_of_year` - ISO week number
- `is_weekend` - 1 if Saturday/Sunday
- `season` - winter, spring, summer, fall
- `month_sin`, `month_cos` - Cyclical encoding (for ML models)
- `dow_sin`, `dow_cos` - Day-of-week cyclical encoding

**Total**: 20+ new features per booking record

## 🎯 Auto-Generated Pricing Weights

After correlation analysis, the system generates **pricing weights** like:

```json
{
  "weights": {
    "weather": 0.35,    // 35% of pricing decision
    "holiday": 0.28,    // 28%
    "season": 0.20,     // 20%
    "temporal": 0.12,   // 12%
    "price": 0.05       // 5%
  },
  "suggestions": {
    "weather": {
      "weight": 0.35,
      "impact": "Very High",
      "recommendation": "Implement dynamic weather-based pricing. Increase rates by 10-15% on optimal weather days."
    },
    "holiday": {
      "weight": 0.28,
      "impact": "High",
      "recommendation": "Implement aggressive holiday pricing. Increase rates by 20-30% during major holidays."
    }
  }
}
```

**These weights can feed directly into your pricing optimizer!**

- Decrease prices by 8% when weather_quality < 40
- Implement dynamic weather-based pricing
```

### Insight 2: Holiday Effect
```
🎉 Holidays explain 28% of variance in bookings

Recommendation:
- Apply 25% premium on major holidays (Christmas, New Year, Easter)
- Apply 15% premium on minor holidays
- Plan capacity 2 weeks before holidays
```

### Insight 3: Seasonal Patterns
```
📅 Strong seasonal patterns detected (20% variance explained)

Recommendation:
- Summer (June-Aug): Base price + 30%
- Spring/Fall: Base price + 10%
- Winter: Base price - 15%
```

### Insight 4: Weekend Premium
```
🏖️ Weekends explain 15% of variance

Recommendation:

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### Caching System

**Weather Cache**: Prevents re-fetching same weather data
```
data/cache/weather_FR_2020-01-01_2023-12-31.parquet
```

**Holiday Cache**: Stores holidays per country/year
```
data/cache/holidays_FR_2024.parquet
```

**Geocode Cache**: Avoids repeated API calls
```
data/cache/geo_frejus_fr.json
```

### Lag Correlation Analysis

Discovers temporal relationships:

```python
# Example: Weather 3 days ago → Today's bookings
lag_df = compute_lag_correlations(df, target='bookings', feature='temp_mean', max_lag=7)

# Result: Peak correlation at lag=-3 (0.42)
# Insight: Good weather 3 days ago increases today's bookings!
```

### Feature Importance Ranking

Combined ranking using all methods:

```python
rankings_df = rank_top_features(correlations_df, top_n=20)

# Output:
#   feature              combined_score  pearson  spearman  mi
#   temp_mean            0.362           0.38     0.35      0.34
#   is_holiday           0.281           0.25     0.29      0.30
#   weather_quality      0.256           0.24     0.28      0.25
```

## 🔌 API Integration (Future)

The enrichment pipeline can be called programmatically:

```python
from core.services.enrichment_pipeline import EnrichmentPipeline
from core.models.business_profile import BusinessProfileManager

# Load profile
manager = BusinessProfileManager()
profile = manager.load()

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = EnrichmentPipeline(profile)

# Enrich data
enriched_df, summary = pipeline.enrich_bookings(
    bookings_df,
    date_col='booking_date'
)

# Save
pipeline.save_enriched_data(enriched_df)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Connect to Pricing Optimizer

Use the auto-generated weights in your optimizer:

```python
from core.analysis.pricing_weights import PricingWeightGenerator

# Load weights
generator = PricingWeightGenerator.load_weights()
weights = generator.weights

# Use in optimizer
optimizer = PriceOptimizer(
    weather_weight=weights.get('weather', 0.3),
    holiday_weight=weights.get('holiday', 0.2),
    season_weight=weights.get('season', 0.2)
)

recommended_price = optimizer.optimize(current_conditions)
```

### 2. Automated Retraining

Set up a scheduled job to re-run analysis monthly:

```python
# cron job or scheduler
if new_bookings_available():
    enriched_df, _ = pipeline.enrich_bookings(new_bookings)
    correlations_df = compute_correlations(enriched_df)
    rankings_df = rank_top_features(correlations_df)

    generator = PricingWeightGenerator()
    weights = generator.generate_weights(rankings_df)
    generator.save_weights()
```

### 3. A/B Testing

Track pricing experiments:

```python
# Experiment: Weather-based pricing
if weather_quality > 80:
    price = base_price * (1 + weights['weather'])
else:
    price = base_price

# Track results
log_experiment(
    experiment='weather_pricing',
    price=price,
    booking_outcome=...,
    weather_quality=weather_quality
)
```
