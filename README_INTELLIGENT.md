## 🎯 What Is This?

This is not just a pricing tool - it's a **pricing intelligence platform** that:

1. 🎓 **Learns from your data** - Discovers what truly drives demand for YOUR business
2. 🌤️ **Enriches automatically** - Adds weather, holidays, and temporal features
3. 📊 **Analyzes deeply** - Uses 5 correlation methods to find hidden patterns
4. 🎯 **Recommends action** - Generates data-driven pricing weights and strategies
5. 🔄 **Improves continuously** - Re-learns as you add new data

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 **Business Onboarding Wizard**
- 3-step setup process
- Automatic geocoding (city → lat/lon)
- Automatic timezone detection
- One-time configuration

### 📊 **Automatic Data Enrichment**
Transforms your raw booking data into a rich analytics dataset:
- ☀️ **Weather data** (temperature, precipitation, sunshine, quality score)
- 🎉 **Holiday data** (190+ countries supported)
- 📅 **Temporal features** (seasons, weekends, cyclical encoding)
- **Total**: 29+ features added per booking

### 🔬 **Multi-Method Correlation Analysis**
Discovers demand drivers using 5 techniques:

- **Lag Correlation** - Time-shifted patterns
- **ANOVA** - Categorical impact

### 🎯 **Auto-Generated Pricing Weights**
Converts correlations into actionable pricing factors:
```json
{
  "weather": 0.35,   // Increase rates 12% on sunny days
  "holiday": 0.28,   // Apply 25% holiday premiums
  "season": 0.20,    // Create seasonal pricing tiers
  "temporal": 0.12,  // Add 10% weekend premium
  "price": 0.05      // Test price adjustments carefully
}
```

### 📈 **Interactive Insights Dashboard**
Beautiful Plotly visualizations:
- Top 10 demand drivers (bar chart)
- Correlation heatmap
- Lag correlation analysis
- Plain-English recommendations
